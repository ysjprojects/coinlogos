                <p>While Coingecko API offers a robust trove of cryptocurrency data, one thing that it lacks is the ability to query cryptocurrency logos. Crypto logos are in demand due to their capability of enhancing the UX/UI component of many cryptocurrency project.
                </p>
                <p>However, current REST API solutions are often limited in scope and query functions. On the other hand, the process of manually gathering the logos and mapping the contract addresses to the logos is too time-consuming.
